# MD5 Datebase

### What is this?
This is a project I randomly started that uses Python to generate all the combinations ascii characters and converting them into md5 to create a database of md5 hashes (A rainbow table of sorts)

The combinations are stored in a file and the hashes are stored in a seperate file. They are both in the same order.

### Current Features
Generates all 3 character ascii combinations

### Upcoming Features
1 and 2 character combinations.
4+ character combinations.
